\label{sec:hard}
In this section we describe a simple reduction from the 
\textsc{disjoint connecting paths} problem to the weighted \TWOCR{} problem.
Using this reduction, we prove that \textsc{weighted \TWOCR{}} can not be approximated
within any multiplicative ratio.
 
Consider the \textsc{disjoint connecting paths} problem.
In this problem an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set of 
pairs $\{(s_1, t_1), (s_2, t_2), \cdots, (s_k, t_k)\}$ are given, 
and the question is whether there are $k$ vertex-disjoint paths that connect $s_i$ to $t_i$.
This problem is known to be NP-hard~\cite{karp1972reducibility}.
This problem can be reduced to the weighted \TWOCR{} problem,
by assigning a unique color to each pair and a weight equal to $1$, 
and assigning a weight of $0$ to all other vertices (and an arbitrary color).
It follows that $k$ disjoint paths exist if and only if the minimum convex recoloring has
a cost of zero, further, 
any approximation algorithm to the later problem must return a solution with a cost of $0$,
if such exists and a solution with cost different than $0$, if such does not exists, 
and thus can solve the \textsc{disjoint connecting paths} problem.
